Hello! This is a note from the Developer of the MCSMs.
There's a guide on how to use these MCSMs on official MCSMs website,
so if you ever feel a bit lost, have a look at it!
Here's the link, if you feel a bit lazy. https://mcsm.jimdosite.com/guide/

If you're a developer or just a casual user with some knowledge of tech, and
you have found a bug on these, please do open an Issue on the GitHub, and I'll have a look at it!
Here's the link: https://github.com/MrKelpy/MCSMs

If you have any MCSM version request, or any other general inquiry related to the mcsms, please
reach over at mcsm.dev@gmail.com. I'll try to answer ASAP!
